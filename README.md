# FineShine Jewellery

FineShine is an online platform specializing in the sale of unique and elegant jewelry, featuring a wide collection of earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, and sets. All pieces are crafted in Ireland and available for shipping. This project was developed as my fifth endeavor in the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer Course, utilizing Django, HTML, CSS, JS, and Python for its creation.
